Description: R on FHIR is an easy to use wrapper around the 'HL7 FHIR' REST API (STU 3). It provides tools to easily read and search resources on a FHIR server and brings the results into the R environment. R on FHIR is based on the FhirClient of the official 'HL7 FHIR .NET API', also made by Firely.
